The Weather Information System is a simple and interactive web application that provides real-time weather updates for any city. It fetches weather data using an API and displays details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with an image representation.
This project was made for evaluation in the final exam and there are some areas that needs to be improved such as adding a database, and real time notification process and also integrate with location tracking
The java code may not be integrated with the web page so please also check for that
